# maker 
This project is really a collection of several 'Maker' projects I have 
going on. Many started as standalone 3D printer onjects, but as I tended 
to write these in OpenSCAD, they naturally benefitted from git and all
it has to offer. As they grow, some of might turn into libraries that 
could be re-used,  but for now they mostly just needed a place to keep 
track of my changes.
