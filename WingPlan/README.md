This is a project to generate ribs for a model airplane plan given the airfoil shape (profile) and chord length. It also Provides a method for defining spars (including leading and trailing edge) that a represented on the profile as cutouts. The resulting path is written to an SVG file. From there it  and can be included in a larger drawing or plan or used to make patterns for cutting parts out by hand or with a laser cutter.
