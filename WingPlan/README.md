### ProfilePlot.py

This is a project to generate ribs for a model airplane plan given the airfoil shape (profile) and chord length. It also provides methods for defining spars (including leading and trailing edge) that are represented on the profile as cutouts. The resulting rib shape is written to an SVG file. From there it can be included in a larger drawing or used to make patterns for cutting parts out by hand or with a laser cutter.

Clark-Y airfoil with spar position shown and the resulting rib with cutouts 

Future Work
- Add inset for sheeted wings
- Generate patterns for cutting foam cores
- Partial sheeting for 2-piece trailing edge and D-Tube contruction
- Option to rotate spars so they are flush with surface
- Generate a series of ribs with differentchord sizes
- Import parameters from another of drawing
- Generate notched spars that mate with rib cutouts
