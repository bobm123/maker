A project to generate ribs for a model airplane plan given the airfoil shape (profile) and chord length. It also
Provides a method for defining spars (including leading and trailing edge) that a represented on the profile as
cutouts. The resulting path is written to an SVG file and can be the used as part of a larger plan or patterns
for cutting out by hand or with a laser cutter.
